# FlexibleParser outside Windows samples

In principle, all the FlexibleParser parts are expected to be used on Windows machines supporting the .NET Framework v. 4.0, but they might also be used on other operating systems and under different conditions.

Note that converting them into a platform-agnostic format like .NET Core isn't straightforward, but neither strictly required by bearing in mind its underlying purpose: to be used by other pieces of software.

The sample codes in this repository create a version of the [original, Windows-based test application](https://github.com/varocarbas/FlexibleParser/tree/master/all_code/Test) which can be run on operating systems different than Windows:
- [MonoDevelop (Linux)](https://github.com/varocarbas/FlexibleParser_NonWindows/tree/master/FlexibleParser_MonoDevelop).
- [.NET Core 2.0 (any OS)](https://github.com/varocarbas/FlexibleParser_NonWindows/tree/master/FlexibleParser_Core).
